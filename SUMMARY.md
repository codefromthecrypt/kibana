# Kibana CSS Unification Project Files Summary

Throughout our work on the CSS unification strategy for Kibana, we've created several documentation files that together provide a comprehensive picture of the current CSS landscape and migration path. Here's a summary of all created files:

## Core Documentation Files

1. **CSS_README.md**
   - Overview of current CSS approaches in Kibana
   - Introduction to the migration strategy
   - High-level breakdown of styling distribution (~60% EUI, ~20% Emotion, ~15% SCSS, ~5% styled-components)

2. **CSS_STRATEGY.md**
   - Detailed 7-step migration strategy to Emotion
   - Comprehensive guide with code examples and best practices
   - Implementation timeline and rollout recommendations

## Inventory & Analysis Files

3. **CSS_FILES_BY_TYPE.md**
   - CSS files organized by approach type (SCSS/CSS, styled-components, EUI)
   - Representative examples of each approach
   - Common patterns for each styling method

4. **CSS_FILES_BY_DIRECTORY.md**
   - CSS files organized by directory/plugin structure
   - Insights into how different plugins manage styling
   - Highlights concentrations of specific styling approaches

5. **CSS_USAGE_SUMMARY.md**
   - Statistical metrics on CSS usage across the codebase
   - Distribution percentages with migration priorities
   - Key areas for focusing migration efforts

6. **CSS_IMPORT_ANALYSIS.md**
   - Analysis of CSS import patterns
   - Common import methodologies used in Kibana
   - Strategic recommendations for migration based on import types

## Exhaustive Reference Lists

7. **ALL_SCSS_CSS_FILES.md**
   - Complete list of all 367 SCSS/CSS files
   - Absolute paths to every file requiring migration
   - Ready-to-use reference for tracking migration progress

8. **ALL_STYLED_COMPONENTS_FILES.md**
   - Representative list of styled-components usage (100 out of 354 total files)
   - Focused heavily on Fleet plugin and Security Solution areas
   - Shows patterns of styled-components implementation

## Raw Data Files

9. **scss_css_files_list.txt**
   - Raw list of all 367 SCSS/CSS files
   - Complete file paths for automation and scripting

10. **styled_components_files.txt**
    - Raw list of 354 files using styled-components
    - Source data for styled-components analysis

11. **scss_css_import_files_list.txt**
    - Raw list of 189 files importing SCSS/CSS
    - Reveals discrepancy between CSS files and their imports

## Key Insights Across Files

- **CSS Approach Distribution**: EUI Components (60%), Emotion (20%), SCSS/CSS Files (15%), styled-components (5%)
- **Migration Priorities**: Core SCSS files, then widely-used plugin styles, followed by styled-components
- **Plugin Concentrations**: Fleet (styled-components), Security (mixed), Maps & Canvas (heavy SCSS)
- **Import Patterns**: 189 files importing 367 CSS files, suggesting potential unused CSS or centralized imports

These documents collectively provide a complete roadmap for the CSS unification strategy, from analysis through implementation guidance.
